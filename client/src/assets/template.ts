INT. SCREENWRITER'S OFFICE - DAY

The room is cluttered with stacks of paper and empty coffee cups. The SCREENWRITER sits at their desk, typing furiously on a laptop.

SCREENWRITER
(typing)
Fountain syntax is a simple way to write screenplays using plain text. It's designed to be easy to read and write, with minimal distractions.

They pause to take a sip of cold coffee, grimacing at the taste.

SCREENWRITER (cont'd)
In Fountain, you can write scene headings like INT. or EXT., followed by a location and time of day. Action lines describe what's happening, while dialogue is indicated by character names followed by their lines.

They glance at a poster on the wall, which reads "Fountain Syntax: Making Screenwriting Simple".

SCREENWRITER (cont'd)
And that's it! With Fountain, you can focus on telling your story without worrying about formatting or software compatibility.

They smile and return to typing, the clacking of keys filling the room.`
